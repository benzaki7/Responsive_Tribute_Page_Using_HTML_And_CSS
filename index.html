            <h3>Here's a time line of Emir Abdelkader's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>1808 -</b> Abdelkader was born near the town of Mascara to a
                    family of religious belief.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1822 -</b> Abdelkader succeeded in reciting the Qur'an by heart
                    at the age of 14.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1823 -</b> He went to Oran for further education. He was a good
                    orator and could excite his peers with poetry and religious
                    diatribes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1825 -</b> He set out on the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, with
                    his father.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1830 -</b> Algeria was invaded by France, French colonial
                    domination over Algeria eventually supplanted domination by the
                    Ottoman Empire and the Kouloughlis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1831 -</b> When the French Africa Army reached Oran in January
                    1831, Abdelkader's father was asked to lead a resistance campaign
                    against them. Muhieddine called for jihad and he and his son were
                    among those involved in early attacks below the walls of the city.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1832 -</b> In the autumn of 1832, he was elected Amir al-Mu'minin
                    (typically abbreviated to "Emir"). Within a year Abdelkader had
                    succeeded in uniting the tribes in the region and in reestablishing
                    security – his area of influence now covered the entire Province of
                    Oran.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1834 -</b> The local French commander-in-chief, General Louis
                    Alexis Desmichels, saw Abdelkader as the principal representative of
                    the area during peace negotiations, and in 1834 they signed the
                    Desmichels Treaty, which ceded near-total control of Oran Province
                    to Abdelkader.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1837 -</b> Treaty of Tafna, signed on 30 May 1837. This treaty
                    gave even more control of interior portions of Algeria to Abdelkader
                    but with the recognition of France's right to imperial sovereignty.
                    Abdelkader thus won control of all of Oran Province and extended his
                    reach to the neighbouring province of Titteri and beyond.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1838 -</b> By the end of 1838, his rule extended east to Kabylie,
                    and south to Biskra, and to the Moroccan border. He continued to
                    fight al-Tijani and besieged his capital at Aïn Madhi for six
                    months, eventually destroying it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1839 -</b> Abdelkader attacked the French as they were
                    colonizing the Plains of Mitidja and routed the invaders. In
                    response the French officially declared war on 18 November 1839.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1841 -</b> Abdelkader was originally encouraged to hear that
                    Bugeaud, the promoter of the Treaty of Tafna, was returning, but
                    this time Bugeaud's tactics would be radically different. This time,
                    his approach was one of annihilation, with the conquest of Algeria
                    as the endgame.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1842 -</b> Until the beginning of 1842 the struggle went in his
                    favor. However, the resistance was put down by Marshal Bugeaud, due
                    to Bugeaud's adaptation to the guerilla tactics employed by
                    Abdelkader. He had lost control of Tlemcen and his lines of
                    communications with Morocco were not effective. He was able to cross
                    the border into Morocco for a respite, but the French defeated the
                    Moroccans at the Battle of Isly. He left Morocco, and was able to
                    keep up the fight to the French by taking the Sidi Brahim at the
                    Battle of Sidi-Brahim.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1847 -</b> Abdelkader surrendered to General Louis Juchault de
                    Lamoricière in exchange for the promise that he would be allowed to
                    go to Alexandria or Acre. He supposedly commented on his own
                    surrender with the words, "And God undoes what my hand has done",
                    although this is probably apocryphal. His request was granted, and
                    two days later his surrender was made official to the French
                    Governor-General of Algeria, Henri d'Orléans, Duke of Aumale, to
                    whom Abdelkader symbolically handed his war-horse. Ultimately,
                    however, the French government refused to honour Lamoricière's
                    promise: Abdelkader was shipped to France and, instead of being
                    allowed to carry on to the East, ended up being kept in captivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1848 -</b> Abdelkader and his family and followers were detained
                    in France, first at Fort Lamalgue in Toulon, then at Pau, and in
                    November 1848 they were transferred to the château of Amboise. Damp
                    conditions in the castle led to deteriorating health as well as
                    morale in the Emir and his followers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1852 -</b> Abdelkader was released by the President and given an
                    annual pension of 100,000 francs on taking an oath never again to
                    disturb Algeria. He then took up residence in Bursa, today's Turkey.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1855 -</b> He moved to Amara District in Damascus. He devoted
                    himself anew to theology and philosophy, and composed a
                    philosophical treatise, of which a French translation was published
                    in 1858 under the title of "Rappel à l'intelligent, avis à
                    l'indifférent", and again in 1977 under the title of "Lettre aux
                    Français". He also wrote a book on the Arabian horse.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1860 -</b> Conflict between the Druze and Maronites of Mount
                    Lebanon spread to Damascus, and local Druze attacked the Christian
                    quarter, killing over 3,000 people. He sheltered large numbers of
                    Christians in the safety of his house. His eldest sons were sent
                    into the streets to offer any Christians under threat shelter under
                    his protection, and Abdelkader himself was said by many survivors to
                    have played an instrumental part in saving them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1865 -</b> He visited Paris on the invitation of Napoleon III and
                    was greeted with both official and popular respect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1883 -</b> Abdelkader died in Damascus and was buried near the
                    great Sufi ibn Arabi in Damascus.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1965 -</b> His body was recovered and is now in the El Alia
                    Cemetery in Algiers. This transfer of his remains was controversial
                    as Abd el-Kader had clearly wanted to be buried in Damascus with his
                    master, ibn Arabi.
